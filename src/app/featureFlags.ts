/**
 * Build-level feature switches.
 *
 * Atlas VTT ships offline-only for its first release. The features below are
 * implemented but not shipped: their code is left in place and gated here, so
 * re-enabling one is a single edit rather than a revert.
 *
 * These are deliberately constants rather than persisted settings — a shipped
 * build must not expose a switch that turns on a feature the release does not support.
